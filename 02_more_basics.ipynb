    "A **class** is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines what data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) an object should have.\n",
    "It is basically like we are making our own variable types! (like lists, strings etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that we make a Class for users on a webbpage:\n",
    "**Key concepts:**\n",
    "- **Class**: The blueprint/template (in our case: Users)\n",
    "- **Object**: An instance of a class (created from the blueprint, e.g a specific user, it would probably be identified primarily through an ID)\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Data stored in the object (things like, ID, bio, height, etc)\n",
    "- **Methods**: Functions that belong to the object (maybe we would create: Users.update_bio(text), User.block(), etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can manipulate itself. In terms of syntax(format for code) that means we use \"self\" to show that every object we create have it's own link to the data. It looks a bit crazy, but you'll get used to it.  \n"
