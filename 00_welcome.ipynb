    "welcome to the Siargao basic python programming training, hosted by Teddy!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal with this training is to teach you the following things:\n",
    "- **General Knowledge:** You should have a better understanding of computers and programming after you finnished this. \n",
    "  Giving you more context when learning new things in the future. It should hopefully also make you a generally more knowledgable person.\n",
    "- **Basic skills:** You should have practiced basic programming skills and understand basic operators, loops, data types, functions, classes etc\n",
    "- **Website focus:** This training will work towards creating web projects and understanding related concepts. Things like computational sciences, data optimization, AI etc will be kept to a minimum. ( a little sad... =/ )  \n",
    "- **Learn how to learn:** I'll try to find a good balance between guidance and fostering an attitude of self-teaching. We'll see how it goes, talk to me about adjustments needed. ( I ain't no actual teacher )\n",
